# DrawnTalk

This repository contains the mobile side of our application, which allows children to converse with their own drawings. We've developed it using Flutter.

## How to Run

Here's how you can run the code on your own:

1. Open the command palette in VS Code with `CMD + Shift + P`.

2. Run the `Flutter: Select Device` command and choose the mobile device you have connected.

3. Build and run the source code with `flutter run`.

Please note that you'll need to have Flutter and Dart properly set up on your machine to run this application.
